.SYNOPSIS
    Step 3: Generate comprehensive report

.DESCRIPTION
    Generates a final report using data from both Step 1 (system info) and Step 2 (performance analysis).
    Demonstrates receiving data from multiple previous steps.

.PARAMETER StepName
    Name of this step

.PARAMETER StepOrder
    Order of this step in the sequence

.PARAMETER AllResults
    Array of all previous step results.
    AllResults[1] contains Step 1 results.
    AllResults[2] contains Step 2 results.
